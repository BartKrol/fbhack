# Tell Me More™

Tell Me More™ provides contextual information based on reverse image search and named entity recognition.
We integrate directly into Facebook and any webpage that has images, making our solution portable and it doesn't require any changes to the existing websites.
Our solution allows users to get direct link to: purchase goods, book flights, trains, buses and get more information about people.

## Revenue Stream
 We allow for online shops to join our platform and we will display links to the products on the websites for users to buy.
 They in return will have to pay us a small fee per referral.
